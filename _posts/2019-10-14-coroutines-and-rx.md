bio: "Josh Keen is (1) a software engineer and instructor at Big Nerd Ranch. A graduate of the Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art, he discovered software as a medium for creating interactive art and has been hooked ever since. When not in front of a computer, you can find him running, practicing Brazilian jiu-jitsu, or creating patches for his modular synthesizer."
