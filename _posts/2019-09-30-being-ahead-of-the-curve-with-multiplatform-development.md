description: "In this episode we chat to Ana Redmond about her adoption of Kotlin/Native for multi-platform development very close to the time it was announced. She went fully onboard with the technology and managed to develop and release a successful educational game. Very inspiring story of someone that went from not knowing Kotlin or Swift, to release a product in a short span of time."
