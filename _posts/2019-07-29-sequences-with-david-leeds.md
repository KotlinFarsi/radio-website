description: "We chat to David about sequences in Kotlin - what they are, how and when to use them, and the performance implications that they have over regular collections."
bio: "Dave is a software developer who focused on Web applications and REST services for many years before eventually making the shift to Android development. He enjoys writing articles (and drawing cartoons) about Kotlin at typealias.com."
