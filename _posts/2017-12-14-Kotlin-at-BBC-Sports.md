description: "We chat with Dai and John on using Kotlin at BBC Sports and the challenges they've faced, along with some of the things they've encountered when using Kotlin, such as whether lack of nullability forces us to be more proactive in terms of error control "
bio: "Dai works as a senior software engineer at BBC Sport, working on their mobile applications, specialising in Android development. He has a range of experience working on Android, iOS, Go and Node.js projects but is currently on a mission to use Kotlin everywhere and anywhere! John currently works as a senior software engineer for BBC Sport, primarily focusing on iOS development. He spends a lot of his time maintaining his personal apps both for android and iOS, oh and he also has a strong coffee addiction."
