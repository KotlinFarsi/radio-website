description: "We chat with Vladislav about Kotless, a Kotlin Serverless Framework, which eliminates the need for a deployment DSL (like Terraform, SAM, CloudFormation or CDK) and makes serverless computations easily understandable for anyone familiar with event-based architectures."
bio: "For the last two years Software Developer at JetBrains. Interests vary from IntelliJ IDEA proofreading plugins to technologies for DevOps (Kotless and others). Big enthusiast of Kotlin, have created numerous libraries for it."
