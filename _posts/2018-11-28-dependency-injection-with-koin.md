description: "We chat with Arnaud about Koin, a new dependency injection framework written from the ground up in Kotlin. We discuss the why, the how and whether in this day and age it makes sense to even have dependency injections frameworks. Spoiler...it does. "
bio: "Mobile & backend developer for more than 11 years. I work at ekito (French tech studio) since 2012, and I have one hand in Android development and the other in Kotlin/Java backend stuff. My current hot topics are Kotlin and the reactive programming."
