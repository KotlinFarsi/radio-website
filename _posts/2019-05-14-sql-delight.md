description: "We chat with Alec Strong about SQL Delight, the multiplatform data access library that have written from the ground up using Kotlin. We discuss some of the differences with other data access frameworks as well as the benefits that Kotlin has provided them."
bio: " I've been doing Android development for 8 years, and have been working on Cash App for the last 5. I'm a core maintainer of SQLDelight and wrote the first version in Kotlin, and now with a recent 1.0 release we're using Kotlin Multiplatform, so I'm excited to take the technology to iOS and more!"
