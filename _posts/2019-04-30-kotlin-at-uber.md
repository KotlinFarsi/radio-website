description: "We talk to a few folks at Uber Engineering about their adoption of Kotlin in a non-conventional setting where they're using Buck. We also discuss some of the work they've been doing in terms of performance analysis with Kotlin and the differences with Java. This work has been published and available for public access (see show notes). Note: first couple of minutes had some feedback issues which were resolved."

Apologies for the slight sound issues the first couple of minutes of the recording. We were having 
some feedback issues.
